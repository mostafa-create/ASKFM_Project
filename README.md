# ASKFM_Project
This is my first OOP project with C++.

In this project i applied some of OOP concepts that i learned.

The program depend on that each user have an Id so he can use the program to get contact with other users.

# Project feauters :
- Login/Signup. 
- Print the questions that have been sent to me.
- Print the questions that i sent to other users.
- Answer a question.
- Delete a question.
- Delete an answer.
- Ask a question.
- Print the username and id for each user.
- Print the answered questions and its answers.
- Logout 
- Delete my account.
  
# Notes :
-Each user must have a username with no spaces.
-This program still needs some exceptions handling, my apologies.
